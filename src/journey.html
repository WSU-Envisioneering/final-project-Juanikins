    <p>This summer in WEB 1400, I learned how to structure HTML pages properly, use semantic elements, and link CSS files to style my websites. 
       I also learned how important clean code and organization are for readability and just how amazing it can look with CSS code. 

    <p>My favorite part of the course was making new webpages with my interests on them. Also learning a skill like this is so cool and im happy I know how too!
       If I could improve anything, I would add more lessons on responsive design so our websites look great on any device.</p>
